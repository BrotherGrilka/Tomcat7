A hymn to Nergal (Nergal B)
When you command the storm which flattens the hostile land, you devastate its evil; you pour it over for as long as it disobeys. You are the great hero of the lands, you speak , you go where no foot has previously been placed. like a vessel with seven spouts. The black-headed gather together at the front. You outpace the pigeons with . You outpace the black and white swallows (?).
